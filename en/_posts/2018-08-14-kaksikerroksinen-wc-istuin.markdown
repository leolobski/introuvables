description: "Due to its innovative layout, this seat fits even the smallest toilets and bathrooms. Forget about separate toilets and cubicles, a new, social form of using the toilet has finally arrived! This is moreover a truly environmentally friendly choice: thanks to the groundbreaking two-level technology, the toilet uses up to two times less water when compared to a toilet with an ordinary seat. Excellently suited for the sanitary facilities of a workplace: a toilet break will no longer be a valid reason for interrupting an important meeting, and the toilet will never be free of the workplace hierarchy again!"
