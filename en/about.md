A few years ago we discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Carelman">Jacques Carelman</a>'s mail order catalogue parody <i>Catalogue d'objets introuvables</i> (translated to English either as <i>Catalog of fantastic things</i> or as <i>A Catalogue of Unfindable Objects</i>). We realized rather quickly that the diversity of consumer goods has not vanished in the internet era, quite the contrary. Online stores are bursting with products no doubt suitable for Carelman's catalogue. What level of uniqueness, ingenuity even, is required of a product in order for it to qualify for the status of an 'unfindable object' in the abundance of the online supermarket? We have been trying to find answers to this question ever since.
